# 🌳 Recursive Tree Growth Simulator

An interactive computer graphics project that visualizes natural tree growth patterns using recursive algorithms and L-systems. Built with Python and Pygame.

## ✨ Features

- **Recursive Tree Generation** - Uses L-system inspired algorithms to create realistic branching patterns
- **Seasonal Transformations** - Experience four different seasons with unique visual effects
  - 🌸 Spring: Light green blooming leaves
  - ☀️ Summer: Dark green full foliage
  - 🍂 Autumn: Orange/red leaves with falling leaf animation
  - ❄️ Winter: Bare branches
- **Animated Growth** - Watch trees grow from seed to full maturity
- **Interactive Controls** - Real-time parameter adjustment with sliders
  - Branch angle (10° - 60°)
  - Recursion depth (5 - 13 levels)
  - Branch length ratio (50% - 80%)
  - Trunk length (80 - 200 pixels)
- **Physics Simulation** - Falling leaves with wind effects in autumn

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1` | Switch to Spring season |
| `2` | Switch to Summer season |
| `3` | Switch to Autumn season (with falling leaves) |
| `4` | Switch to Winter season |
| `SPACE` | Restart growth animation |
| **Sliders** | Adjust tree parameters in real-time |
